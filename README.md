# MongoDB Fundamentals Assignment - Week 1

This assignment demonstrates MongoDB fundamentals including database setup, CRUD operations, advanced queries, aggregation pipelines, and indexing for the PLP Bookstore database.

## üìÇ Project Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ insert_books.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ queries.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Week1-Assignment.md
```

## üöÄ Prerequisites

1. **MongoDB Installation**: Either install MongoDB Community Edition locally OR set up a free MongoDB Atlas cluster
2. **Node.js**: Make sure Node.js is installed on your system
3. **MongoDB Driver**: The project uses the official MongoDB Node.js driver

## üìã Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Local MongoDB Installation

1. **Install MongoDB Community Edition**
   - Download from [MongoDB Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
   - Follow the installation guide for your operating system
   - Start the MongoDB service

2. **Verify MongoDB is running**
   ```bash
   mongosh
   ```

### Option 2: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud)

1. **Create a free account** at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
2. **Create a new cluster** (free tier available)
3. **Get your connection string** and update the `uri` variable in both `insert_books.js` and `queries.js`
4. **Replace** `'mongodb://localhost:27017'` with your Atlas connection string

## üîß Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install mongodb
   ```

3. **Configure connection** (if using Atlas)
   - Update the `uri` variable in both files with your connection string
   - Ensure your IP is whitelisted in Atlas

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Scripts

### Step 1: Populate the Database

Run the insert script to create the database and add sample book data:

```bash
node insert_books.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Connected to MongoDB server
12 books were successfully inserted into the database

Inserted books:
1. "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee (1960)
2. "1984" by George Orwell (1949)
...
Connection closed
```

### Step 2: Execute All Queries

Run the queries script to demonstrate all MongoDB operations:

```bash
node queries.js
```

**The script will execute:**
- Basic CRUD operations
- Advanced queries with filtering and sorting
- Aggregation pipelines
- Index creation and performance analysis

## üìä What the Scripts Demonstrate

### **insert_books.js**
- Connects to MongoDB
- Creates `plp_bookstore` database
- Inserts 12 sample books into `books` collection
- Each book contains: title, author, genre, published_year, price, in_stock, pages, publisher

### **queries.js**
- **Task 2 - Basic CRUD Operations:**
  - Find books by genre
  - Find books published after a specific year
  - Find books by author
  - Update book prices
  - Delete books by title

- **Task 3 - Advanced Queries:**
  - Complex filtering with `$and` operator
  - Projection to return specific fields
  - Sorting (ascending/descending)
  - Pagination with `limit()` and `skip()`

- **Task 4 - Aggregation Pipelines:**
  - Calculate average price by genre
  - Find author with most books
  - Group books by publication decade

- **Task 5 - Indexing:**
  - Create single field index on title
  - Create compound index on author and published_year
  - Use `explain()` to analyze query performance

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Schema

Each book document has the following structure:

```javascript
{
  title: "Book Title",           // String
  author: "Author Name",         // String
  genre: "Genre",               // String
  published_year: 1984,         // Number
  price: 12.99,                 // Number
  in_stock: true,               // Boolean
  pages: 328,                   // Number
  publisher: "Publisher Name"    // String
}
```

## üß™ Testing Your Setup

1. **Verify MongoDB connection**
   ```bash
   mongosh
   use plp_bookstore
   db.books.countDocuments()
   ```
   Should return: `12`

2. **Check specific queries**
   ```bash
   db.books.find({ author: "George Orwell" })
   db.books.find({ genre: "Fiction" })
   ```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Connection Error**
   - Ensure MongoDB is running (local) or Atlas cluster is active
   - Check connection string format
   - Verify network access for Atlas

2. **Module Not Found**
   ```bash
   npm install mongodb
   ```

3. **Authentication Error (Atlas)**
   - Check username/password in connection string
   - Ensure IP is whitelisted

4. **Database Not Found**
   - Run `insert_books.js` first to create the database

## üìà Assignment Completion Checklist

- [x] MongoDB setup (local or Atlas)
- [x] Database `plp_bookstore` created
- [x] Collection `books` with 12+ documents
- [x] Basic CRUD operations implemented
- [x] Advanced queries with filtering, projection, sorting
- [x] Pagination implemented
- [x] Aggregation pipelines for data analysis
- [x] Indexes created with performance analysis
- [x] All queries saved in `queries.js`

## üéØ Learning Outcomes

After completing this assignment, you will understand:
- MongoDB database and collection structure
- CRUD operations with the MongoDB driver
- Query operators (`$gt`, `$and`, `$regex`, etc.)
- Projection and sorting techniques
- Aggregation framework for data analysis
